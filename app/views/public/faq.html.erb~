<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>What kind of foods do you guys sell on Taste Basket?</h3>
<p>We sell specialty and artisan food products made by independent food producers. We favour products that are made of natural ingredients with little or no artificial flavourings or preservatives. We can't guarantee that all our food products are organic, natural or fair trade, but we do strongly support those that are, and chances are in the future you will see a lot more of them as we get more and more producers on board.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Why Taste Baskets each month?</h3>
<p>As strong supporters of food artisans and small independent food businesses, it becomes difficult to choose amongst so much good stuff! We eliminate the decision process and provide you with a yummy Taste Basket each month. All you have to do is open, enjoy, and wait for another food taste basket next month!</p>

<h3>Why a private trial?</h3>
<p>Taste Basket is just starting out and as such, we’d like to invite a select few (25 to be exact) to participate during our private trial period.

And you get the benefit of being the first to enjoy the next best thing in food! </p>
