<br/>


<h3>A Tasting Community</h3>
<p>“Taste Basket” is a tasting community of foodies, food lovers, and food purveyors that discover traditional and innovative foods not typically found in your grocery store. Together, we’ll discover a world of flavour each month and share our findings, reviews, and opinions with everyone on our “Taste Basket” website. With each feedback, our Tasting Basket will be that much more tantalizing to your taste buds.</p>
<br/>


<h3>An Eating Curiosity and Tasty Discovery</h3>
<p>We love searching for delicious goodies and purveying the world for that next tasty treat. There’s just so much joy and anticipation to find out what’s inside! At “Taste Basket”, you’ll get to discover 5 or more new food products each month, a tasty mystery to fuel your hungry anticipation!</p>
<br/>


<h3>Eliminate Confusion and Anticipate the Mysterious</h3>
<p>We are strong supporters of food artisans and independent small food businesses. But there’s just so much good stuff out there that it becomes difficult to choose! That’s why at “Taste Basket”, we eliminate the decision process for you and provide you with a fun Taste Basket each month. You might not know exactly what you’ll find, but the excitement and fun comes from the anticipation!</p>
<br/>


<h3>Supporting Independent Small Businesses</h3>
<p>“Taste Basket” celebrate specialty artisanal foods prepared by independent, small-scale food artisans. Our mission is to support food artisans by making their gourmet foods accessible to everyone beyond the gourmet grocery, helping food artisans connect with everyday consumers, to grow their business, and to offer specialty fine foods to use at home or as food gift baskets delivered right to your doorstep. In a time when many people feel increasingly distant from the foods that they eat, artisanal foods carry inherent values by granting foodie consumers an opportunity to know where their food comes from, to see the hands that made it, and to understand how it’s made.</p>
</br>

<h3>Online Food Marketplace</h3>
<p>Use “Taste Basket” as your online shopping destination for artisanal foods and goodies from around the world, a place to find food gifts, shop for food gift baskets with tea, coffee, cheese, chocolate, or cookies, or to participate in our signature monthly Taste gift Basket to savour the variety of specialty artisanal and international foods. Like what you found in your Taste Basket? You can also buy them individually in our online food marketplace.</p>
